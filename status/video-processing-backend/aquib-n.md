JET-196 implemented and moved to review. The audio/lyrics workflows now derive
orientation from the clips (majority wins, ties go landscape) while holding the
frame size fixed, so landscape callers are unchanged — verified by rendering both
orientations in the container. Both caption canvases follow the frame. D-005
records why the size is not derived. Nothing committed.

Next: someone runs the ticket's test steps against a real portrait job and closes
it. Two things left open — the caption preview is still landscape-only (noted on
video-captions.md, needs its own ticket), and nobody has confirmed with the rate
card owner that no video-service rate card declares a `resolution` enum selector;
if one does, a portrait job's settlement would fail where a landscape one does not.
